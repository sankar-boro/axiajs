# AxiaJS -  Typedoc Documentation

## Overview

We use [typedoc](https://typedoc.org) to turn comments in our typescript into markdown pages which can be copied into [the Axia Docs repo](https://github.com/sankar-boro/axia-docs). Each time a new version of AxiaJS gets deployed to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axia) then typedocs should be regenerated and pasted into the docs repo.

## Steps

### Dependencies

A recent build of one of the typedoc dependencies broke this workflow so for now make sure that the dependencies are the following versions.

```json
"typedoc": "^0.18.0",
"typedoc-plugin-external-module-name": "^4.0.3",
"typedoc-plugin-markdown": "^2.4.0",
```

### Generate Docs

Generate typedocs using the `docsmd` yarn/npm script.

```zsh
yarn docsmd
Rendering [========================================] 100%

Documentation generated at /path/to/axiajs/docsMD

âœ¨  Done in 8.09s.
```

This will generate `README.md` and 3 directories, `classes/`, `interfaces/` and `modules/` in the `docsMD/` directory of your local `axiajs/` repo.

### API

First rename the newly generated `README.md` to `api.md`. Next open `api.md` and clean up the formatting.

* Remove the generated headers and replace them w/ API and AxiaJS w/ a link to the current build
* Nest the list items per their parent category
* Clean up the body copy. Ex: `API-AVM` -> `AVM` and `API-AVM-Credentials` -> `Credentials`

## Copy to Docs Repo

Now copy the `api.md` file and the 3 directories, `classes/`, `interfaces/` and `modules/` into the `/path/to/docs/build/tools/axiajs/` directory of your local `axia-docs/` repo.

Confirm that everything worked by running `yarn start` and viewing the new AxiaJS docs on `localhost`. If that is successful next run `yarn build` to confirm that docusaurus is able to properly build. Once that is successful, branch off of `master`, commit your changes and push them on your new feature branch to the remote `axia-docs` repo and create a PR.
